<Section title="üé≠ **The Challenge of Replacing Legends**">
HBO Max‚Äôs new Harry Potter series faces an almost impossible mission: **live up to the legacy of the original films**. With actors like John Lithgow (Dumbledore) and Nick Frost (Hagrid), the studio is taking bold steps.

> _‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not imitating ‚Äî we‚Äôre reimagining,‚Äù_ said the showrunner.

Can these fresh faces truly replace Harris, Gambon, and Coltrane?

<Section title="1. üåü **John Lithgow as Albus Dumbledore**" imgSrc={johnLithgow} imgAlt="john lithgow as dumbledore">
- **Who he is**: 3-time Emmy winner (*Dexter*, *The Crown*).  
- **The challenge**: Dumbledore must feel **wise but mysterious**. Lithgow has depth, but his vibe is more grounded than his predecessors.  
- **Trivia**: He‚Äôs the first **American Dumbledore** ‚Äî breaking the all-British tradition.
</Section>

<Section title="2. üßî **Nick Frost as Rubeus Hagrid**" imgSrc={nickFrost} imgAlt="nick frost as hagrid">
- **Who he is**: Comedy star in *Shaun of the Dead* and *Hot Fuzz*.  
- **Why it could work**: Frost has Hagrid‚Äôs **warm heart**, but fans wonder if he can show the character‚Äôs vulnerability.  
- **Controversy**: Some fear his comedic background could **undermine Hagrid‚Äôs depth**.
</Section>

<Section title="3. üìö **Janet McTeer as Minerva McGonagall**" imgSrc={janetMcTeert} imgAlt="janet mcteer as mcgonagall">
- **Who she is**: Oscar nominee (*Albert Nobbs*).  
- **Strength**: Her commanding presence fits McGonagall‚Äôs strict persona.  
- **Comparison**: Maggie Smith was iconic ‚Äî but McTeer could bring **new dramatic layers**.
</Section>

<Section title="4. üêç **Paapa Essiedu as Severus Snape**" imgSrc={paapaEssiedu} imgAlt="paapa essiedu as snape">
- **Who he is**: Breakout star in *I May Destroy You* (BAFTA 2021).  
- **The risk**: Alan Rickman‚Äôs Snape is **unforgettable**. Essiedu promises a **younger, more visceral** take.  
- **Curious fact**: He‚Äôs the first **non-white Snape** ‚Äî a step toward more inclusive casting.
</Section>

<Section title="5. üé© **What About the Supporting Cast?**">
- **Luke Thallon (Quirrell)**: A theater-trained actor, ideal for portraying **nervous energy**.  
- **Paul Whitehouse (Filch)**: Known for comedy, likely a more **grotesque version** than David Bradley.
</Section>

<Section title="üîÆ **Will It Surpass the Original Films?**">
**Pros of the series**:  
- More time to flesh out characters (like Snape‚Äôs past).  
- A massive budget for **epic magical visuals** (HBO invested $200M).

**Cons**:  
- Constant comparisons with the beloved cast.  
- Risk of **overacting** (Frost as Hagrid is a concern for some).
