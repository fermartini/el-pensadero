    <Section title="🧙‍♂️ The Wildest Theory in the Harry Potter Fandom?">
  	Hello, witches and wizards! Welcome to _The Pensieve_, I’m Fernando, and today we’re diving into one of the <strong style={{ color: "#928952" }}>wildest and most debated theories</strong> in the Harry Potter world. <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Get ready</span>, because after this, you might never see the saga the same way again.
  </Section>

    <Section title="Clue #1: The 'Ron is Dumbledore' Connection" imgSrc={ronEsDumbledore} imgAlt="Ron Weasley and Albus Dumbledore are the same person" loading="eager">
  	Sounds crazy, but once we dig into the details, the theory <strong>starts to make sense</strong>. There are <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>hidden clues</span> in the books, odd coincidences, and connections that could suggest that <strong style={{ color: "#928952" }}>Ron traveled back in time</strong>... and became the most powerful wizard of all.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🌀Where did this theory come from?">
  	This theory started on fan forums years ago. Many believe there are <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>real clues</span> in the books to support it. It’s based on:
  	- <strong>Physical similarities</strong> between the two 
  	- <strong>Details about time travel</strong> 
  	- <strong>Suspicious narrative choices</strong> by J.K. Rowling
  </Section>

    <Section title="⏳ The 'How': Time Travel is Real (and Powerful)">
  	We know that <strong style={{ color: "#928952" }}>time is flexible</strong> in the wizarding world.
  	- In _The Prisoner of Azkaban_, Hermione uses a Time-Turner to go back just a few hours. 
  	- In _The Deathly Hallows_, we learn that <strong>the Ministry had more powerful time-turners</strong> capable of sending someone centuries into the past.
  	So... if time travel is possible... <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>what’s stopping Ron from doing it?</span>
  </Section>

    <Section title="Clue #2: The Physical Similarities (Nose, Scar)" imgSrc={cicatrizRon} imgAlt="Ron and Dumbledore’s scar">
  	### Height, nose, scar…
  	Ron and Dumbledore are both <strong>tall and slim</strong>, with <strong>long, distinct noses</strong>. Dumbledore mentions having a scar shaped like the London Underground. Coincidentally, Ron <strong>suffers a serious leg injury</strong> while escaping the Ministry. Coincidence?
  </Section>

    <Section title="Clue #3: The Red Hair Connection">
  	Dumbledore had <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>reddish hair in his youth</span>, just like Ron. With age, it turned white. Nothing odd… unless we consider that <strong>they might be the same person</strong> at different stages of life.
s </Section>

    <Section title="Clue #4: Dumbledore's 'Unusual' Trust in Ron">
  	Throughout the saga, Dumbledore shows an <strong style={{ color: "#928952" }}>unusual level of trust</strong> in Ron. Why? Maybe it’s because <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>he remembers being Ron</span>, and that’s why he <strong>guides him subtly</strong>, without messing with destiny.
  </Section>

    <Section title="Clue #5: The King's Cross 'Plot Hole'">
  	In the limbo scene where Harry dies and speaks with Dumbledore... <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Ron is never mentioned</span>. That’s <strong>strange</strong>. If Dumbledore were Ron, <strong>it would make sense for him to avoid mentioning himself</strong> to protect the timeline.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🕯️The Deluminator and Ron’s disappearance">
  	Ron leaves the trio for weeks. When he returns, he says the Deluminator “called him.” What was he really doing during that time? One theory suggests that he <strong style={{ color: "#928952" }}>discovered advanced time-turners</strong> and <strong>started planning his trip to the past</strong>.
  </Section>

    <Section title="⚖️ The Problems: What About Grindelwald & The Weasleys?">
  	1. <strong>Dumbledore’s history is documented</strong> since childhood. But… what if Ron, upon traveling back, <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>took over that identity</span>?
  	2. <strong>The Weasleys never mention Ron disappearing.</strong> But if the trip happened later in life… there’s no contradiction.
  	3. <strong>The story with Grindelwald.</strong> Could it fit Ron? Maybe, if <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>that life was always part of his new destiny</span>.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🧩What if it’s all true?">
  	Dumbledore never married or had children. What if, in his life as Ron, he <strong style={{ color: "#928952" }}>already experienced all that</strong> and chose not to repeat it?
img </Section>

  <Section title="❓Madness or truth?">
  	After all this evidence, it’s your turn to decide: <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Did Ron really travel through time and become Dumbledore?</span> Or is it just a fun, unfounded theory?
img </Section>

  <Section title="What do you think?">
  	I’ll be reading your thoughts in the blog comments or on the YouTube video. <strong>Are you #TeamRonIsDumbledore or #NoWay?</strong> If you enjoyed this theory, <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>keep exploring more at _The Pensieve_</span>. There are plenty more crazy ideas to uncover!
