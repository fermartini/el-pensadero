    ## Hello, witches and wizards!

    Welcome to _The Pensieve_, I’m Fernando, and today we’re diving into one of the <strong style={{ color: "#928952" }}>wildest and most debated theories</strong> in the Harry Potter world.

    <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Get ready</span>, because after this, you might never see the saga the same way again.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🧙‍♂️Are Ron Weasley and Dumbledore the same person?" imgSrc={ronEsDumbledore} imgAlt="Ron Weasley and Albus Dumbledore are the same person" loading="eager">
    Sounds crazy, but once we dig into the details, the theory <strong>starts to make sense</strong>.
    There are <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>hidden clues</span> in the books, odd coincidences, and connections that could suggest that <strong style={{ color: "#928952" }}>Ron traveled back in time</strong>... and became the most powerful wizard of all.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🌀Where did this theory come from?">
    This theory started on fan forums years ago. Many believe there are <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>real clues</span> in the books to support it.

    It’s based on:

    - <strong>Physical similarities</strong> between the two  
    - <strong>Details about time travel</strong>  
    - <strong>Suspicious narrative choices</strong> by J.K. Rowling
  </Section>

  <Section title="⏳The Time-Turner and temporal travel">
    We know that <strong style={{ color: "#928952" }}>time is flexible</strong> in the wizarding world.

    - In _The Prisoner of Azkaban_, Hermione uses a Time-Turner to go back just a few hours.  
    - In _The Deathly Hallows_, we learn that <strong>the Ministry had more powerful time-turners</strong> capable of sending someone centuries into the past.

    So... if time travel is possible...  
    <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>what’s stopping Ron from doing it?</span>
  </Section>

  <Section title="👃Physical similarities" imgSrc={cicatrizRon} imgAlt="Ron and Dumbledore’s scar">
    ### Height, nose, scar…

    Ron and Dumbledore are both <strong>tall and slim</strong>, with <strong>long, distinct noses</strong>.

    Dumbledore mentions having a scar shaped like the London Underground. Coincidentally, Ron <strong>suffers a serious leg injury</strong> while escaping the Ministry. Coincidence?
  </Section>

  <Section title="✨What about the hair?">
    Dumbledore had <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>reddish hair in his youth</span>, just like Ron. With age, it turned white.

    Nothing odd… unless we consider that <strong>they might be the same person</strong> at different stages of life.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🧠Does Dumbledore remember being Ron?">
    Throughout the saga, Dumbledore shows an <strong style={{ color: "#928952" }}>unusual level of trust</strong> in Ron. Why?

    Maybe it’s because <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>he remembers being Ron</span>, and that’s why he <strong>guides him subtly</strong>, without messing with destiny.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🚂The weirdest detail: King's Cross">
    In the limbo scene where Harry dies and speaks with Dumbledore...  
    <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Ron is never mentioned</span>.

    That’s <strong>strange</strong>.

    If Dumbledore were Ron, <strong>it would make sense for him to avoid mentioning himself</strong> to protect the timeline.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🕯️The Deluminator and Ron’s disappearance">
    Ron leaves the trio for weeks. When he returns, he says the Deluminator “called him.”

    What was he really doing during that time?

    One theory suggests that he <strong style={{ color: "#928952" }}>discovered advanced time-turners</strong> and <strong>started planning his trip to the past</strong>.
  </Section>

  <Section title="⚖️The contradictions">
    1. <strong>Dumbledore’s history is documented</strong> since childhood. But… what if Ron, upon traveling back, <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>took over that identity</span>?
    2. <strong>The Weasleys never mention Ron disappearing.</strong> But if the trip happened later in life… there’s no contradiction.
    3. <strong>The story with Grindelwald.</strong> Could it fit Ron? Maybe, if <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>that life was always part of his new destiny</span>.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🧩What if it’s all true?">
    Dumbledore never married or had children.  
    What if, in his life as Ron, he <strong style={{ color: "#928952" }}>already experienced all that</strong> and chose not to repeat it?
  </Section>

  <Section title="❓Madness or truth?">
    After all this evidence, it’s your turn to decide:

    <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Did Ron really travel through time and become Dumbledore?</span>  
    Or is it just a fun, unfounded theory?
  </Section>

  <Section title="What do you think?">
    I’ll be reading your thoughts in the blog comments or on the YouTube video.  
    <strong>Are you #TeamRonIsDumbledore or #NoWay?</strong>

    If you enjoyed this theory, <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>keep exploring more at _The Pensieve_</span>.  
    There are plenty more crazy ideas to uncover!
