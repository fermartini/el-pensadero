    <Section title="💘1. Harry and Hermione: The Romance J.K. Rowling Scrapped?">
    In the early drafts of <b>Harry Potter</b>, <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>J.K. Rowling seriously considered</span> making Hermione Granger and Harry Potter a couple. In these initial versions of the saga, <strong>Ron Weasley was pushed to the background</strong>, while Harry and Hermione shared a <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>much closer relationship</span>, as reflected in their many scenes together. However, <strong>Rowling changed course</strong>, and the relationship with Ron prevailed, although she later admitted that, in hindsight, <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic", color: "#928952" }}>the choice was more nostalgic than logical</span>.

    <Section title="🧬2. The Peverell Connection: Linking Harry, Voldemort, and Dumbledore">
    Although never mentioned in the films, the <strong>three most important characters of the saga</strong> share a common ancestor: <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Ignotus Peverell</span>, the original owner of the <strong>Invisibility Cloak</strong>. This detail directly links <strong>Voldemort, Dumbledore, and Harry</strong>, <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>connecting their destinies in an unexpected way</span>.

    <Section title="🎭3. The Actor Swap: Why Crabbe Was Replaced (And Few Noticed)">
    <strong>Vincent Crabbe</strong>, one of Draco Malfoy’s cronies, disappears in <em>The Deathly Hallows</em>. He was replaced by <strong>Blaise Zabini</strong> due to <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>legal issues with actor</span> <strong>Jamie Waylett</strong>. This change, which went unnoticed by many, <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>shows how external events influenced the storyline</span>.

  . <Section title="🚽4. The Gross Secret: Hogwarts Didn't Always Have Bathrooms">
    In the <strong>early centuries of Hogwarts</strong>, wizards didn’t need bathrooms; they simply <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>used spells to get rid of their waste</span>. This curiosity was revealed by <strong>J.K. Rowling</strong> on Pottermore and <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic", color: "#928952" }}>puts into perspective how ancient and rudimentary the castle once was</span>.

    <Section title="😔5. Why Do Dementors Affect Harry So Much?">
    <strong>Dementors</strong> are terrifying creatures that feed on happiness. But, <strong>why do they affect Harry more?</strong> The answer lies in his trauma: from the <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>death of his parents</span> to the <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>abuse from the Dursleys</span>, <strong>Harry has suffered more than most</strong>. Rowling has stated that Dementors were inspired by her own <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic", color: "#9289Setting" }}>experience with depression</span>, giving them even deeper impact on the young wizard.
