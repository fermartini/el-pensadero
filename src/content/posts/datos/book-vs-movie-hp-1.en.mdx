    <Section title="📘1. Was Dumbledore *Really* Headmaster When Tom Riddle Was a Student?">
    In the films, an <strong>elderly Dumbledore</strong> appears in Harry’s flashbacks, suggesting he’s always been the headmaster of <strong>Hogwarts</strong>.  
    But in the books, the headmaster at that time was <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Armando Dippet</span>, a weak-willed wizard easily manipulated by Riddle.
    <strong>Dumbledore was merely a Transfiguration professor</strong>, though already suspicious of Riddle and closely watching him.  
    This changes their dynamic entirely: <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>Dumbledore sensed the danger, but lacked the authority to stop it.</span>
  </Section>

    <Section title="👂2. The Chamber of Secrets Scene (The *Much* Darker Book Version)">
    In the movie, Harry hears a voice, sees a message, and Filch appears.  
    But in the book, the scene is <strong>far more chilling</strong>. It begins at <strong>Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party</strong>, full of rotting food and ghostly gloom.
    Hungry and uncomfortable, Harry leaves — and then hears a guttural voice:
    <em>“Rip... tear her... so hungry...”</em>  
    He runs through the halls with Ron and Hermione, until they find a red message on the wall:  
    <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>“The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir... beware.”</span>  
    The floor is wet, Mrs. Norris is petrified, and <strong>Malfoy appears with a twisted grin</strong>:  
    <em>“Hope the Mudbloods got the message.”</em>  
    <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>Much more intense than in the film.</span>
  </Section>

    <Section title="🧪3. Hermione, the Rule-Breaker: Stealing for Polyjuice Potion">
    In the movies, Hermione seems to know everything. But in the book, <strong>she didn’t even have the recipe</strong>.  
    She had to trick Lockhart into signing a permission slip for the Restricted Section of the library.
    Then, she <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>stole dangerous ingredients</span> like Boomslang skin from Snape’s storage.  
    The potion was brewed in a disused bathroom over several weeks.  
    <strong>A secret magical mission barely hinted at in the movies.</strong>
  </Section>

    <Section title="😨4. The Paranoia: Harry, the 'Heir of Slytherin'">
    After the attacks, the mood at Hogwarts turns suffocating.  
    <strong>Students avoid Harry</strong>, whispering behind his back, convinced he’s the Heir of Slytherin.  
    One muggle-born even locks himself in the common room for days.
    Harry overhears:  
    <em>“It has to be him. Who else speaks Parseltongue?”</em>  
    He tries to defend himself, but <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>no one believes him</span>.  
    Only after Hermione is attacked does suspicion begin to fade.
    <strong>A heavy atmosphere that the movie doesn’t fully capture.</strong>
  </Section>

    <Section title="🕷️5. The Real Reason Ron Fears Spiders">
    It’s never explained in the films, but in the book we learn that <strong>Fred played a cruel prank</strong> on Ron when he was just three:  
    <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>He turned his teddy bear into a giant spider</span>.
    Since then, Ron’s arachnophobia makes perfect sense.  
    <strong>Who wouldn’t be traumatized?</strong>
  </Section>

  s <Section title="🧹6. Filch's Tragic Secret: Why He *Really* Hates Students">
    Filch isn’t just a grumpy caretaker. In the books, we learn he’s a <strong>Squib</strong> — born to magical parents but unable to use magic.  
    He even tries to learn through a “Quick Spell” course, but fails miserably.
    <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>Imagine living surrounded by magic and never being able to use it.</span>  
    That frustration turns into resentment.  
    <strong>This adds tragic depth to his character.</strong>

    <Section title="🏠7. The Burrow: A Home of Love and Magical Chaos">
    In the movies, The Burrow looks cozy.  
    But in the books, it’s <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>a whirlwind of magical chaos</span>.
    They throw gnomes over the fence to de-gnome the garden, there’s a ghost in the plumbing, explosions in Fred and George’s room, and a family clock that says things like:  
    <em>“Time for tea”, “Mortal peril”, “You’re late”</em>.
s   <strong>A home full of love — and uncontrollable magic.</strong>
  </Section>

    <Section title="💀8. Rowling's Master Plan: The Cursed Necklace (Foreshadowed!)">
    But that same necklace <strong>was first shown in “The Chamber of Secrets”</strong>.
    When Harry ends up in Borgin & Burkes via Floo Powder, he hides and sees: s
    <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>Lucius Malfoy lift the necklace, saying it already killed ten people</span>.
s   Rowling planted the clue long before.  
    <strong>Proof of how carefully woven the magical world really is.</strong>
