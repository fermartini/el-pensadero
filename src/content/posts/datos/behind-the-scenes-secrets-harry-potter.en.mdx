    <strong>And at the end, don’t miss the full video with even more secrets!</strong>

  <Section title="🧃 The Day Snape Lost His Cool (Without Saying a Word)" imgAlt="Alan Rickman as Snape, staring intensely">
    During the filming of *Goblet of Fire*, Matthew Lewis and Rupert Grint accidentally spilled a milkshake on Alan Rickman’s black BMW seat.  
    His response?  
    Total silence… followed by an unspoken rule:  
    <em>They were banned from going near his car from that day on.</em>

    Even off-screen, Snape was intimidating.

  <Section title="👁️‍🗨️ The Look That Silenced the Director">
    Director Mike Newell once told Rickman, “Your eyes are terrifying.”  
    Rickman took out a contact lens and revealed his real eye color.  
    Newell was speechless.

    Fun fact: Snape wore dark lenses to make his gaze even more intense.

  <Section title="🏫 Real-Life Clans at Hogwarts">
    Daniel, Rupert, and Emma were inseparable.  
    Tom Felton led the Slytherin squad, known for their intense pranks—one of which almost made Emma Watson cry.  
    How did the crew manage such teenage chaos?

    With a real red-card system. If someone laughed or misbehaved, they got fined.

  <Section title="🐹 A Fancy Funeral for a Hamster">
    Emma Watson used to bring her pet hamster, Millie, to set.  
    When Millie passed away, the set design team crafted a velvet-lined coffin with her name engraved on it.  
    Honestly, it was more elegant than most character deaths in the saga.

    Yes, the love for magical (and muggle) creatures was very real.

  <Section title="💇‍♂️ Lucius Malfoy’s Iconic Hair">
    Jason Isaacs, who played Lucius, requested long hair to look more sinister.  
    But it kept getting in his eyes, so he started tilting his head back while acting.  
    That’s how his famously arrogant pose was born.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🦉 Real Magic vs. CGI Magic">
    The floating candles in the Great Hall in *The Philosopher’s Stone* were real, suspended with wires.  
    The problem? Some melted and dripped hot wax onto the actors.  
    After a few scares, they switched to CGI.

    Turns out, digital magic is a bit safer.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🕷️ Rupert Grint’s Very Real Fear">
    Rupert has a real phobia of spiders. During the scene with Aragog, he asked not to see the creature beforehand.  
    His terrified expression? 100% genuine.  
    To this day, he still can’t watch that scene.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🎭 Legendary Improvs">
    Some of the most iconic lines weren’t even in the script.  
    Like when Draco says: “Didn’t know you could read.”  
    Tom Felton forgot the real line and improvised… and it stayed.

    Sometimes, mistakes are pure movie magic.

  <Section title="💘 Secret Crushes on Set">
    Emma Watson had a crush on Tom Felton.  
    Daniel Radcliffe had a thing for Helena Bonham Carter.  
    He even wrote her a letter: “I love you. I wish I’d been born 20 years earlier.”

    Hogwarts wasn’t just about magic—it was full of broken hearts too.

  <Section title="🧹 The Mysterious Exit of Madam Hooch">
    Ever noticed she vanished after *The Philosopher’s Stone*?  
    It wasn’t about the story. It was about money.  
    The actress turned down her pay… so Warner Bros. cut her character.

    Just like that, Madam Hooch was grounded.
  </Section>

  <Section title="😂 Code Word: Snape in a Speedo">
    Whenever scenes got too intense, the actors would whisper “Snape in a Speedo” to lighten the mood.  
    The Hogwarts set wasn’t just magical—it was hilarious.
