<Section title="🧠 Was Harry Potter a Horcrux? The Darkest Theory">
Harry Potter wasn’t just the Boy Who Lived. He was also the Horcrux no one chose. An accidental vessel of Voldemort’s soul, marked by the curse… and by silence. This theory, backed by clues across the entire series, **completely transforms** how we view the saga.
</Section>

<Section title="🕯️ The Origin: The Accidental Human Horcrux">
On the night in Godric’s Hollow, when Voldemort killed Lily Evans, something went wrong: the spell rebounded, and a fragment of his soul, torn by the act, lodged itself in Harry. Without wanting to, without knowing it, **Harry became a living Horcrux**— one that breathed, felt… and struggled to understand who he really was.
</Section>

<Section title="🐍 The Signs: Parseltongue, the Scar, and the Visions">
- He could speak Parseltongue, like the Slytherins. 
- He felt pain in his scar whenever Voldemort was near. 
- He had visions and dreams that weren’t his own. 
- He even **felt compassion** for his enemy.
    Harry was a mirror of two souls: his own… and his worst enemy’s.
</Section>

<Section title="⛓️ Free Will or Magical Manipulation?">
How free was Harry, really? Was he a hero by choice… or by design? Voldemort’s shadow was always present. Every decision, every act, might have been influenced by something that **wasn’t truly his**.
</Section>

<Section title="🧙‍♂️ Dumbledore’s Greatest Secret: Why Did He Stay Silent?">
Dumbledore knew the truth. And he chose silence. He prepared Harry to sacrifice himself, but **never told him why**. Was it out of compassion? Strategy? Or because he too was trapped by his own plan?
</Section>

<Section title="🦇 Snape, the Key to Destiny">
Snape kept the memory that revealed everything. His love for Lily was the final bridge between darkness and truth. Thanks to him, Harry understood what he was… and accepted his fate without resentment. He walked into the Forbidden Forest, ready to die.
</Section>

<Section title="⚡ The Death That Freed His Soul (Not Killed Him)">
When Voldemort kills him, he doesn’t destroy Harry. He destroys the part of himself living inside him. **Harry is finally just Harry.** Free from hatred, from visions, from the weight of being something he never chose to be.
</Section>

<Section title="🪞 Unanswered Questions Remain">
- How does one rebuild a fractured soul? 
- How much of Harry was truly him? 
- And how much was marked by that darkness?
    Victory came, yes. But **wounds of the soul aren’t always healed by magic**.
</Section>

<Section title="🤐 Who Else Knew and Said Nothing?">
Only Snape and Dumbledore? What if McGonagall, Lupin, or Sirius also knew… but chose to stay silent? Maybe the truth was so terrifying… even the brave didn’t dare to name it.
</Section>

    <Section title="🧩 A Horcrux That Changed Everything">
Harry was a hero. But he was also a weapon. A mystery. And a victim of a fate he never asked for.
