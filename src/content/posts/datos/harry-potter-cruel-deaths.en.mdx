    <Section title="🧠1. A Fate Worse Than Death: What Bellatrix Did to Neville's Parents">
  	Some fates are worse than death. <strong>Frank and Alice Longbottom</strong>, Neville’s parents, were victims of <strong>Bellatrix Lestrange</strong> and other Death Eaters. They were subjected to <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>sustained Cruciatus Curse torture</span> — combined with a silencing charm. <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>They couldn’t scream</span>. They couldn’t release the pain. The torment was so brutal that <strong>they lost their minds</strong>. They didn’t die… but they ceased to be who they were. Living <em>empty shells</em>, they became haunting reminders of the cost of magical war.

    <Section title="💔2. The Secret of Ariana Dumbledore: The Death That Haunted Albus">
  	Officially, <strong>Ariana Dumbledore</strong> died from a stray curse during a fight between her brothers and Grindelwald. But some believe the truth was far darker. Whispers tell of <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>an uncontrollable curse</span> that struck her down, leaving her lifeless on the floor. No one knew who cast the fatal spell, but <strong>guilt and grief haunted Albus</strong> for the rest of his life. This tragedy shaped his destiny… and made him fear power.

    <Section title="🕯️3. The Forgotten: Regulus, Burbage, and Snape's Tragic End">
  	The wizarding world hides many horrors behind its spells. <strong>Regulus Black</strong> died alone, trying to destroy one of Voldemort’s horcruxes, surrounded by <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>deadly curses and Inferi</span>. <strong>Charity Burbage</strong>, Muggle Studies professor, was <em>murdered in front of everyone</em> at the Death Eaters' table and fed to Nagini. <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>A cruel punishment for teaching tolerance.</span> And <strong>Severus Snape</strong> was killed by Voldemort in a misguided attempt to control the Elder Wand — not knowing <em>Snape wasn’t its true master</em>. He died for a lie, in solitude, with Lily Potter’s eyes staring back at him through her son.

    <Section title="☠️4. Cedric Diggory: The Pointless Death That Changed Everything">
  	<strong>Cedric Diggory</strong> was Hufflepuff’s pride — brave, fair, and respected. During the Triwizard Tournament, <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>Voldemort killed him instantly</span> with a cold <strong>“Avada Kedavra”</strong>. No warning. No chance to fight back. Just a sudden, brutal end. Cedric died <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>for being in the wrong place at the wrong time</span> — a chilling reminder of how fragile life is in the magical world.

    <Section title="💔5. Fred Weasley: The Final Laugh" imgAlt="Fred Weasley: The Final Laugh" imgSrc={weslay}>
  	In the chaos of the Battle of Hogwarts, <strong>Fred Weasley</strong> was fighting bravely alongside his family, sharing a joke with his brother Percy. Then, <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>an explosion ended his life</span>. His death was devastating. The cheerful twin, the eternal prankster, fell in battle. George, his other half, was never the same again. <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>He died laughing — but left behind unbearable silence.</span>

    <Section title="👶6. Remus and Tonks: The Unseen Deaths That Created an Orphan">
  	<strong>Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks</strong> died in the Battle of Hogwarts — but <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>their deaths were never shown in detail</span>. Their bodies were found side by side, after the fighting ended. They left behind their newborn son, <strong>Teddy Lupin</strong>, repeating Harry’s own tragedy: <em>growing up an orphan because of war</em>. Their end was quiet… but their absence thundered.
