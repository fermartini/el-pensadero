  <Section title="üß†1. Neville‚Äôs Parents: Tortured Into Madness">
    Some fates are worse than death. <strong>Frank and Alice Longbottom</strong>, Neville‚Äôs parents, were victims of <strong>Bellatrix Lestrange</strong> and other Death Eaters.  
    They were subjected to <span style={{ color: "#928952", fontWeight: "bold" }}>sustained Cruciatus Curse torture</span> ‚Äî combined with a silencing charm.

    <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>They couldn‚Äôt scream</span>. They couldn‚Äôt release the pain. The torment was so brutal that <strong>they lost their minds</strong>.  
    They didn‚Äôt die‚Ä¶ but they ceased to be who they were. Living <em>empty shells</em>, they became haunting reminders of the cost of magical war.

    Whispers tell of <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>an uncontrollable curse</span> that struck her down, leaving her lifeless on the floor.

  <Section title="üïØÔ∏è3. Other Deaths That Shook the Wizarding World">
    The wizarding world hides many horrors behind its spells.

    <strong>Charity Burbage</strong>, Muggle Studies professor, was <em>murdered in front of everyone</em> at the Death Eaters' table and fed to Nagini.  
    <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>A cruel punishment for teaching tolerance.</span>

    And <strong>Severus Snape</strong> was killed by Voldemort in a misguided attempt to control the Elder Wand ‚Äî not knowing <em>Snape wasn‚Äôt its true master</em>.  
    He died for a lie, in solitude, with Lily Potter‚Äôs eyes staring back at him through her son.

  <Section title="‚ò†Ô∏è4. Cedric Diggory: A Life Taken in a Second">
    <strong>Cedric Diggory</strong> was Hufflepuff‚Äôs pride ‚Äî brave, fair, and respected. During the Triwizard Tournament, <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>Voldemort killed him instantly</span> with a cold <strong>‚ÄúAvada Kedavra‚Äù</strong>.  
    No warning. No chance to fight back. Just a sudden, brutal end.  
    Cedric died <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>for being in the wrong place at the wrong time</span> ‚Äî a chilling reminder of how fragile life is in the magical world.

    Then, <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>an explosion ended his life</span>.

    His death was devastating. The cheerful twin, the eternal prankster, fell in battle.  
    George, his other half, was never the same again.  
    <span style={{ color: "#928952" }}>He died laughing ‚Äî but left behind unbearable silence.</span>

    Their bodies were found side by side, after the fighting ended.

    They left behind their newborn son, <strong>Teddy Lupin</strong>, repeating Harry‚Äôs own tragedy:  
    <em>growing up an orphan because of war</em>.  
    Their end was quiet‚Ä¶ but their absence thundered.
