    ## 🐍 What if Harry Potter had been sorted into Slytherin?

    “Not Slytherin, not Slytherin…”  
    But what if the Sorting Hat hadn’t listened?

    Today on El Pensadero, let’s dive into an alternate timeline:  
    Harry Potter chooses power over friendship.  
    A darker Hogwarts. A twisted destiny.  
    Are you ready to watch the Boy Who Lived... become a legend (or a threat)?

  <Section title="🟩 Chapter 1: The Birth of a Slytherin" imgAlt="Harry Potter with Slytherin scarf">
    The Sorting Hat senses the darkness within Harry… and this time, it ignores his pleas.  
    “SLYTHERIN!” it shouts.  
    The hall goes silent. Few clap.

    Harry walks to the green table—alone.  
    Draco Malfoy doesn’t become his friend. But Snape looks at him differently:  
    not as James’s son, but as Lily’s.

    And so begins the story of a different Harry Potter:  
    isolated, without Ron or Hermione, but with a new mentor.
  </Section>

  <Section title="🧪 Chapter 2: Snape's Favorite">
    In Slytherin, Harry finds silence and books—not friends.  
    Snape doesn’t despise him. Instead, he invites him into his office and shares something unexpected:  
    his love for Lily, Harry’s mother.

    For the first time, Harry feels real affection.  
    He starts to trust Snape.  
    He calls him “Master.”

    <em>Can you imagine Snape as Harry’s mentor and father figure?</em>
  </Section>

  <Section title="🧠 Chapter 3: Greed and Control">
    Without Ron or Hermione, Harry never confronts Quirrell.  
    He observes. Analyzes. He gets close to Quirrell… and pretends to help.

    Snape investigates alone.  
    Harry whispers:  
    “Master… Voldemort’s return isn’t a threat. It’s an opportunity.”

    The Boy Who Lived begins playing his own game.

  <Section title="🧪 Chapter 4: An Army of Shadows">
    When Voldemort returns, no one stops him.  
    The Stone vanishes. Dumbledore stays silent.  
    But Voldemort underestimates Snape and Harry.

    Together, they infiltrate the Death Eaters.  
    They learn their rituals and begin searching for the Horcruxes from within.  
    Neither the Order, nor the Death Eaters, nor Voldemort suspect a thing.

    <strong>Allies or rivals? Snape and Harry become a deadly duo.</strong>
  </Section>

  <Section title="🐍 Chapter 5: A New Kind of Power">
    Harry learns Occlumency. He becomes a duelist. He embraces dark magic.  
    His fame becomes myth.  
    Some call him The Chosen One. Others, The Heir of Slytherin.

    But only Snape knows the truth:  
    Harry doesn’t want to save the world.  
    He wants revenge.

    <em>How far would you go for your parents?</em>
  </Section>

  <Section title="🔥 Chapter 6: The Fall of Voldemort">
    Snape and Harry destroy the Horcruxes—alone.  
    When everything is ready, they capture Voldemort. Trick him. Torture him.  
    Harry doesn’t shake. Doesn’t hate. Only satisfaction remains.

    They don’t kill him.  
    They hand him over to the Dementors—to suffer for eternity.

    <strong>The Boy Who Lived... is now the Boy Who Conquered.</strong>
  </Section>

  <Section title="🧊 Epilogue: Hero or Tyrant?">
    Harry doesn’t return to Hogwarts. He gives no speeches. He vanishes.

    Some say he lives in the Forbidden Forest.  
    Others claim he rules from the shadows.

    Only Snape knows the truth:  
    from time to time, an owl delivers a letter to his window, written in green ink:  
    “For Lily and James.”

    <strong>What do you think? Would Harry be a hero, a villain… or something worse?</strong>
