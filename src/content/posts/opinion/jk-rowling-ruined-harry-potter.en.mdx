<Section title="üé¨ Did Rowling Ruin Her Own Legacy?">
J.K. Rowling: the woman who **gave us one of the most magical worlds ever written**...

...and the same woman who one day woke up and thought:
> _"What if I destroy everything I built‚Äîwith awkward spin-offs, weird plot twists, and a secret daughter of Voldemort?"_

At **El Pensadero**, we ask the uncomfortable question:
**Did Rowling ruin the legacy of Harry Potter?**

> üß† Short answer? Yes... but no... but maybe. Let‚Äôs break it down with receipts, passion, and a bit of healthy sarcasm.
</Section>

<Section title="üß© 1. The Perfect Ending Was Already There">
*Harry Potter* was more than a story. It was a **generational experience**:
- We cried for Dobby  
- Hated Umbridge  
- Had an identity crisis with the Sorting Hat  

The series ended with a *cheesy epilogue*, sure‚Äîbut it **felt complete**.

> The real issue? Rowling just **didn‚Äôt let it go**.

And thus, the ‚Äú**forced extended universe syndrome**‚Äù was born.
</Section>

<Section title="üêç 2. Wait‚Ä¶ Nagini Was a Woman?" imgSrc={nagini} imgAlt="Nagini as a woman in Fantastic Beasts">
In *Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald*, we learn Nagini‚ÄîVoldemort‚Äôs snake‚Äîwas actually... a cursed woman?

Backstory. Emotions. A face.  
And **absolutely no mention of this** in the original books.

What was once a terrifying creature is now an **awkward retcon** that breaks the mystery.

> ‚ú® Sometimes, magic works best when things are left unsaid.
</Section>

<Section title="üé≠ 3. *The Cursed Child*: Fanfic in Disguise" imgSrc={cursedChild} imgAlt="The Cursed Child stage play">
*Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* feels like a **2010 fanfiction plot gone wild**:

- Voldemort has an emo daughter with Bellatrix.
- Time travel to bring him back.
- A tone that reads more parody than tribute.

Even though Rowling approved the script, the result **contradicts her own universe**.

> ‚ùå Voldemort‚Äîthe man incapable of love‚Äîhas a child?  
> That‚Äôs when it all started to crack.
</Section>

<Section title="üí¨ 4. The Author Who Overexplained Everything" imgSrc={rowlingTweet} imgAlt="Controversial tweet from J.K. Rowling">
Since the books ended, Rowling became **that aunt who explains everything on Twitter**.

- ‚ÄúDumbledore was gay‚Äù‚Ä¶ but **never in the books**.
- Wizards used to poop on the floor and vanish it. Yep.
- Pottermore. Interviews. Threads. TMI all over.

Instead of letting fans breathe and interpret, she **overwrote her own magic**.

> üßº When you explain every detail, you wash away the wonder.
</Section>

<Section title="‚öñÔ∏è 5. So... Did She Ruin It All?">
**No, not everything.** But yes, she **shattered part of the illusion**.

üìñ The books are still brilliant.  
üé¨ But later additions (*Fantastic Beasts*, *Cursed Child*) feel like **sloppy, soulless cash grabs**.

> The problem isn't the story.  
> It's that we no longer trust the storyteller.
</Section>

<Section title="üî• Final Thought: Is It Her... or Us?">
Rowling built something eternal.  
But like any wizard who dabbles too much in dark magic‚Ä¶ she **distorted her own creation**.

Did she ruin *Harry Potter*?
- Many say: **yes**.
- Others argue: **we‚Äôre the ones who couldn‚Äôt let go**.

> üí¨ What do you think?  
> Did Rowling destroy her work‚Äîor did we just outgrow it?
