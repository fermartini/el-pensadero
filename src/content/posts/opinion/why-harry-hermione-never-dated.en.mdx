<Section title="💔 Why Didn’t Harry and Hermione End Up Together?">
We’ve all been there: rewatching the movies or rereading the books, and suddenly thinking…  
**“Wait. Shouldn’t Harry and Hermione be a couple?”**

Their bond seemed unbreakable. Intelligence, bravery, loyalty — they shared everything.  
And yet, J.K. Rowling decided their story would *never* turn romantic.  

So, why didn’t it happen? Was it just because of Ron? Or was there a deeper reason?  
Let’s dive into one of the most debated “what ifs” in the Harry Potter fandom.
</Section>

<Section title="🧩 A Friendship Stronger Than Romance" imgSrc={harryHermione} imgAlt="Harry and Hermione together">
Rowling wasn’t simply writing a love triangle. She wanted to explore something *rare* in young adult fiction: a **deep, platonic friendship** between a boy and a girl.  

Hermione supported Harry through every battle, every loss, every fear. But the way she cared for him was more like a sister than a lover. Their bond was unconditional — and that’s what made it so powerful.  

> Sometimes, true love doesn’t have to be romantic.

<Section title="🔥 Why Ron and Hermione Made Sense" imgSrc={ronHermione} imgAlt="Ron and Hermione moment">
Hermione didn’t complete Harry — she completed Ron.  

Their constant bickering, the sparks, the tension… that’s what created narrative drama. With Harry, everything was too *perfect*. They agreed, they trusted, they understood. Great for friendship — terrible for storytelling.  

Rowling herself admitted that Ron and Hermione’s relationship wasn’t easy. She even said they would “probably need couple’s therapy.” But that was the point: **realism over fantasy**.

<Section title="📖 Rowling’s 2014 Confession" imgSrc={rowlingInterview} imgAlt="Rowling interview about Harry and Hermione">
In 2014, Rowling shocked fans when she revealed she once thought Harry and Hermione might have worked better as a couple.  

For a moment, the fandom went wild. Had we been right all along?  

But Rowling clarified: while Harry and Hermione *could* have been romantic, the story wasn’t about giving readers the perfect fantasy. It was about showing that love can be messy, flawed, and unexpected.  

> Harry didn’t need Hermione as a partner — he needed her as his anchor.

<Section title="💡 Why Ginny, Not Hermione">
So why Ginny? Because Ginny represented something Harry had always longed for: **a normal life**.  

With Ginny, Harry found joy, fun, and a chance at family. With Hermione, the relationship would have felt like duty, another burden — more like his connection with Cho Chang.  

The magic of Harry and Hermione wasn’t about passion. It was about survival, trust, and chosen family.

<Section title="✨ Conclusion: The Love That Wasn’t Meant to Be">
Harry and Hermione will forever be one of fandom’s favorite “what ifs.”  

- For some, they *should* have been endgame.  
- For others, their pure friendship is exactly what made the saga so unique.  

Rowling’s choice may divide fans, but it gave us something rare: a story where love doesn’t always mean romance. And maybe that’s the real magic.  

> What about you?  
> Did you ever imagine them as a couple — or do you believe their friendship was the greatest love story of all?
