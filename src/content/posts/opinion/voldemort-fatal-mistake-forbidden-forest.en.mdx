  <Section title="üå≤ **The Forbidden Forest and the Illusion of Victory**" imgSrc={voldemortBosque} imgAlt="Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest standing over Harry Potter‚Äôs body">
    One of the most striking moments in *The Deathly Hallows* comes when Harry walks willingly toward his fate.  
    He knows a fragment of Voldemort‚Äôs soul lives inside him, yet he steps forward without resistance, accepting the Killing Curse.  

    Harry falls. Voldemort collapses as well, stunned for a moment, but then convinces himself he has succeeded:  
    The Boy Who Lived‚Ä¶ lives no more.

  <Section title="ü™Ñ **Narcissa Malfoy‚Äôs Lie**" imgSrc={narcissaHarry} imgAlt="Narcissa Malfoy leaning over Harry in the forest">
    The Death Eaters erupt in celebration, but Narcissa Malfoy approaches Harry‚Äôs body.  
    In a whisper, she asks: *‚ÄúIs Draco still alive?‚Äù*  

    Harry answers yes. In that instant, Narcissa makes a crucial choice: she lies to Voldemort and declares Harry dead.  

    Here lies Voldemort‚Äôs ultimate mistake: blinded by arrogance, he accepts her word without ever checking for himself.

  <Section title="üëë **The Arrogance That Sealed His Fate**">
    Let‚Äôs remember who Tom Riddle really was: an orphaned boy who sought absolute power, convinced he had conquered death through his Horcruxes.  

    To him, showing weakness before his followers was worse than death itself.  
    And in his boundless ego, he never imagined anyone could deceive him.  

    That blind confidence was the crack that doomed him.

  <Section title="üìñ **Book vs. Movie: What Changes**" imgSrc={harryProtegido} imgAlt="Harry lying in the forest, shielded by sacrifice">
    In the movie, the scene is brief: Voldemort casts the curse, Narcissa lies, and they march back to the castle.  

    But in the book, Rowling adds a crucial detail: Voldemort feels weakened after casting the Killing Curse, though he hides it to avoid seeming vulnerable.  

    At the same time, Harry‚Äôs sacrifice weaves an invisible shield over his allies‚Äîno one fighting beside him dies while he lies on the ground.  
    Love and courage protect the battlefield‚Ä¶ and Voldemort never notices.

  <Section title="‚ö° **The True Defeat**">
    The final duel in the Great Hall feels decisive, but Voldemort‚Äôs downfall was sealed much earlier:  
    in the Forbidden Forest, when he chose to believe only what he wanted to believe.  

    - Was it his arrogance?  
    - The protection of Harry‚Äôs sacrifice?  
    - Or the Elder Wand, which never truly belonged to him?  

    > What do you think was the real reason behind the Dark Lord‚Äôs fall?
