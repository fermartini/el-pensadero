  <Section title="✨ **What is Entre Muggles?**" imgSrc={entreMugglesLogo} imgAlt="Entre Muggles community logo">
    **Entre Muggles** is an online community created by and for fans of J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World.  
    The name plays with the word *muggle*, used in the Harry Potter books to describe non-magical people, 
    and captures the idea of an open, welcoming space where anyone can share their love for the saga.
